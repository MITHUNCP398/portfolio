                <h3>Spider-Man</h3>
                <P>Spider-Man's secret identity is Peter Benjamin Parker. Initially, Peter was depicted as a teenage high-school student and an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and enemies such as the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom. In his origin story, Spider-Man gets his superhuman spider-powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. These powers include superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination, and balance; clinging to surfaces and ceilings like a spider; and detecting danger with his precognition ability called "spider-sense". He builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design, which he uses both for fighting and for web-swinging across the city. Peter Parker originally used his powers for his own personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that Peter could not stop, he began to use his powers to fight crime by becoming Spider-Man.</P>

            <h3>The Green Goblin</h3>
            <img src="https://www.writeups.org/wp-content/uploads/Green-Goblin-Spider-Man-movie-Osborn-Willem-Dafoe-l.jpg" alt="The Green Goblin">
            <p>The Green Goblin is a fantastic villain in his own right, but it's arguably Peter's connection with the Osborn family that makes him one of the very best. Many other characters have taken up the mantle over the years, but it's Norman and his son that really bring the character to life.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="col2">
            <h3>Doctor Octopus</h3>
            <img src="https://i0.wp.com/tooys.mx/media/catalog/product/cache/39c7ff5a74bd9fa282a021db605b774d/d/o/doc-ock_marvel_spider-man-no-way-home-11.jpg"alt="Venom">
            <p>While the majority of Spider-Man's enemies rely predominantly on their superhuman strength and high-tech weaponry, Dr. Octopus typically tackles the web-slinger with brains rather than brawn. It's a tactic that's paid off too, with Doc Ock one of the very few Marvel villains to have succeeded in bringing about the demise of the masked hero.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col3">
            <h3>Venom</h3>
            <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/venom-let-there-be-carnage-006-1630316198.jpeg?crop=0.554xw:0.983xh;0.188xw,0.0170xh&resize=1200:*" alt="Venom">
            <p>First appearing back in the eighties, Venom is a sentient alien symbiote that is able to bond with other lifeforms. It started out as a living spider suit but later evolved into an entity in its own right. Although it's Spider-Man who first plays host to the creature, its most infamous occupant is the Spider-Man-hating journalist, Eddie Brock.</p>

                Mysterio</h3>

                <p>Mysterio may have taken his time to show up in one of the series' many movies, but he's been on the Spider-Man scene since 1964. Much like Scarecrow in the Batman series, Quentin Beck isn't blessed with any superhuman powers per se but is instead an illustrious illusionist and a more than capable chemist to boot.</p>
